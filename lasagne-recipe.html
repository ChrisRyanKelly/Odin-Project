    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the ragù, melt the 20g butter in a large ovenproof pan over a
        medium<br />
        heat and gently fry the pancetta for about 8 minutes until crisp and the
        fat<br />
        has rendered. Add the onion, carrot, celery and garlic, then soften
        gently<br />
        for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add the beef/veal and pork mince to the pan and fry, stirring to break
        up<br />
        any lumps. Pour in the milk, grate over a little nutmeg, then simmer
        very<br />
        gently for 20-30 minutes. Heat the oven to 150°C/130°C fan/gas 2.<br />
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Stir the wine, tomatoes and most of the oregano into the pan, then
        <br />
        season. Cover with the lid slightly ajar, then oven-cook for 3 hours
        until <br />
        the meat is tender and the sauce is thick. Check every now and then,<br />
        adding a little water if needed.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make the bechamel. Melt the 60g butter in a medium
        heavy-based <br />
        pan over a medium-high heat. Add the flour and stir for 3-4<br />
        minutes until the mixture starts to smell toasty. Gradually add the
        milk,<br />
        then simmer, whisking, for 6-8 minutes until thickened. Remove from
        the<br />
        heat, stir in 20g of the parmesan and a good grating of fresh nutmeg,
        then<br />
        season well.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        To assemble, spread a little of the bechamel or ragù over the base of
        the<br />
        baking dish, then cover with slightly overlapping lasagne sheets.
        Spoon<br />
        over a third of the bechamel, sprinkle with a little of the
        remaining,<br />
        parmesan, then top with half the ragù. Add another layer of lasagne,
        then<br />
        top with half the remaining bechamel and all the remaining ragù. Add
        the<br />
        final layer of lasagne, then spread with the remaining bechamel.
        Scatter<br />
        with the rest of the parmesan, then set aside for a bit, ideally
        overnight in<br />
        the fridge, but an hour at room temperature will do (see Make Ahead).<br />
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        When ready to bake, heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Bake the,<br />
        lasagne for 40-45 minutes until golden and bubbling. Garnish with the<br />
        remaining oregano to serve.
      </li>
